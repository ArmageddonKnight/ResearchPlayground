# Analyzing Programming Puzzle Performance on Easily Accessible Models

## Summary

Driver by open-source models and accessible compute resources, this paper
presents evaluate results of GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on P3, a dataset for solving
Python Programming Puzzles.

Quality [8/10]
  - Since this paper is trying to apply an existing, well understood solution
    to a new problem, the authors do not list any algorithms, equations, or 

Clarity [10/10]
  - The paper is clearly written. However, I have the following advice:
    - The abstract contains lots of technical details that could be moved to the
      Introduction section.
    - The Introduction section should be an extended version of the abstract
      (i.e., it should be self-contained). However, the current writing stops
      after presenting the motivation of using GPT-2 and GPT-Neo.
